# SENTRAVYN Implementation Roadmap

Build incrementally. Each phase has a gate; do not start the next phase with unresolved critical failures.

## Phase 0 — Repository audit and planning

- Inspect current repository and toolchain.
- Confirm product scope and deployment constraints.
- Create architecture decision records.
- Create `DESIGN.md` and threat register.
- Define initial data providers and legal/licensing review.
- Produce milestones, estimates and dependencies.

**Gate:** Auditable plan, architecture and risks accepted.

## Phase 1 — Foundation

- Monorepo and package management.
- Next.js web/admin shells.
- Expo mobile shell.
- NestJS backend.
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS and Redis local environment.
- Shared types and API client.
- CI checks, lint, typecheck and tests.
- Environment and secrets templates.

**Gate:** Reproducible local setup and green baseline pipeline.

## Phase 2 — Trust and identity

- Authentication and sessions.
- Roles and permissions.
- Audit event framework.
- Data provider registry.
- Provenance model.
- Place verification model.
- Admin review foundations.

**Gate:** Authorisation and audit tests pass.

## Phase 3 — Alert ingestion

- First documented provider adapter.
- Schema validation and quarantine.
- CAP support where applicable.
- Deduplication and update/cancel lifecycle.

**Gate:** Fixtures, integration tests and source provenance verified.

## Phase 4 — Geospatial and services

- PostGIS queries.
- MapLibre integration.
- Place discovery.
- Distance calculations.
- Verification labels.
- Shelter-specific evidence workflow.
- Stale/unknown states.
- Licensed tile and geocoding provider.

**Gate:** Spatial correctness and no false shelter claims.

## Phase 5 — Safety content

- Reviewed guide schema.
- Version and approval workflow.
- Hazard-specific guide pages.
- Source references and review dates.
- Localization foundation.
- Content freshness and retirement.

**Gate:** Safety reviewer approves content workflow and initial published material.

## Phase 6 — Notifications and offline

- WebSocket live updates.
- Reconnect cursor sync.
- Web Push, FCM and APNs.
- Delivery receipts and retries.
- PWA service worker.
- Offline guides and saved contacts.

**Gate:** Offline and reconnect scenarios pass.

## Phase 7 — Family safety and mobile

- Consent-based location sharing.
- Expiry and revocation.
- Emergency contacts.
- Household plan.
- Expo iOS and Android builds.
- Permission and privacy review.

**Gate:** Device testing and privacy review pass.

## Phase 8 — Design completion

- Apply `DESIGN.md` to all surfaces.
- Custom background system.
- Premium typography.
- Responsive layouts.
- Cinematic ASCII footer.
- Accessibility and reduced-motion review.
- Browser/device screenshots.

**Gate:** Visual review passes at all target sizes.

## Phase 9 — Production hardening

- Load and stress tests.
- Security testing.
- Backup restore.
- Provider outage simulation.
- Queue failure recovery.
- Monitoring and alerting.
- Incident response runbooks.
- Terraform staging and production.
- Legal, privacy and safety review.

**Gate:** All critical delivery checks pass.

## Phase 10 — Controlled launch

- Limited geography/provider coverage clearly disclosed.
- Operational ownership and support.
- Data quality monitoring.
- Incident response on-call process.
- Public limitations and terms.
- Gradual rollout and rollback plan.

**Gate:** Launch approval from product, security, operations and safety owners.
